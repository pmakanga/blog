Services
--------
Provides networking between pods

Types of Services:-
Cluseter IP - Sets up an easy to remember URL to access a pod. Only exposes pods in a Cluseter
Node Port - Makes the pod accessible from outside the cluster. Only used for dev purposes
Load Balancer - Makes a pod accessible from outside the cluster. This is the right way to expose a pod to the outside world
External Name - Redirects an in-cluster request to a CNAME url.....
